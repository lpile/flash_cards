# Flash Cards

## Iteration 1
Cards

A Card represents a single flashcard in our set. It stores a question, an answer, and a category.

Use the tests provided to drive the development of your Card class. From the root directory of your project, run the test like this: `rspec spec/card_spec.rb`

```
# double check that you are in your flashcards project directory!
pry(main)> require './lib/card'
#=> true

pry(main)> card = Card.new("What is the capital of Alaska?", "Juneau", :Geography)
#=> #<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c8 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> card.question
#=> "What is the capital of Alaska?"

pry(main)> card.answer
#=> "Juneau"

pry(main)> card.category
#=> :Geography
```

Turns

Create a Turn class and an accompanying test file with the following methods:

initialize(string, card) - A turn is initialized with two arguments. The first is a string representing a guess to a card’s question. The second argument is a Card object representing the current flashcard being shown.
guess - This method returns the guess
card - This method returns the Card
correct? - This method returns a boolean indicating if the guess matched the answer on the Card.
feedback - This method either returns "Correct!" or "Incorrect." based on whether the guess was correct or not.
The Turn class should respond to the following interaction pattern:
```
pry(main)> require './lib/turn'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/card'
#=> true

pry(main)> card = Card.new("What is the capital of Alaska?", "Juneau", :Geography)
#=> #<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c8 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> turn = Turn.new("Juneau", card)
#=> #<Turn:0x00007f99842f0998 @card=#<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c9 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:geography>, @guess="Juneau">

pry(main)> turn.card
#=> #<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c8 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> turn.guess
#=> "Juneau"

pry(main)> turn.correct?
#=> true

pry(main)> turn.feedback
#=> "Correct!"
We also want to make sure that incorrect guesses are handled properly.

pry(main)> require './lib/turn'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/card'
#=> true

pry(main)> card = Card.new("Which planet is closest to the sun?", "Mercury", :STEM)
#=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @answer="Mercury", @question="Which planet is closest to the sun?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> turn = Turn.new("Saturn", card)
#=> #<Turn:0x00007f998413ee60 @card=#<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @answer="Mercury", @question="Which planet is closest to the sun?", @category=:STEM>, @guess="Saturn">

pry(main)> turn.card
=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @answer="Mercury", @question="Which planet is closest to the sun?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> turn.guess
=> "Saturn"

pry(main)> turn.correct?
=> false

pry(main)> turn.feedback
=> "Incorrect."
```

## Iteration 2
Storing Cards in a Deck

Create a Deck class with an accompanying test file. A Deck is initialized with an array of Card objects. A Deck should also be able to return cards based on a given category. The Deck class should respond to the following interaction pattern:

```
pry(main)> require './lib/card'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/deck'
#=> true

pry(main)> card_1 = Card.new("What is the capital of Alaska?", "Juneau", :Geography)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa16104e160 @answer="Juneau", @question="What is the capital of Alaska?", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> card_2 = Card.new("The Viking spacecraft sent back to Earth photographs and reports about the surface of which planet?", "Mars", :STEM)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa160a62e90 @answer="Mars", @question="The Viking spacecraft sent back to Earth photographs and reports about the surface of which planet?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> card_3 = Card.new("Describe in words the exact direction that is 697.5° clockwise from due north?", "North north west", :STEM)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa161a136f0 @answer="North north west", @question="Describe in words the exact direction that is 697.5° clockwise from due north?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> cards = [card_1, card_2, card_3]

pry(main)> deck = Deck.new(cards)
#=> #<Deck:0x00007fa160a38ed8...>

pry(main)> deck.cards
#=> [#<Card:0x00007fa16104e160...>, #<Card:0x00007fa160a62e90...>, #<Card:0x00007fa161a136f0...>]

pry(main)> deck.count
#=> 3

pry(main)> deck.cards_in_category(:STEM)
#=> [#<Card:0x00007fa160a62e90...>, #<Card:0x00007fa161a136f0...>]

pry(main)> deck.cards_in_category(:Geography)
#=> [#<Card:0x00007fa16104e160...>]

pry(main)> deck.cards_in_category("Pop Culture")
#=> []
```

The Round

A Round will be the object that processes responses and records guesses. A Round is initialized with a Deck. The idea is that when we start a Round, the current card is the first in the deck (the first in the Deck’s array of Cards). When we make a guess, the guess is recorded, and the next card in the deck becomes the current card.

The take_turn method is the crux of this problem. The take_turn method takes a string representing the guess. It should create a new Turn object with the appropriate guess and Card. It should store this new Turn, as well as return it from the take_turn method. Also, when the take_turn method is called, the Round should move on to the next card in the deck.

A Round should respond to the following interaction pattern:

```
pry(main)> require './lib/card'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/turn'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/deck'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/round'
#=> true

pry(main)> card_1 = Card.new("What is the capital of Alaska?", "Juneau", :Geography)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa16104e160 @answer="Juneau", @question="What is the capital of Alaska?", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> card_2 = Card.new("The Viking spacecraft sent back to Earth photographs and reports about the surface of which planet?", "Mars", :STEM)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa160a62e90 @answer="Mars", @question="The Viking spacecraft sent back to Earth photographs and reports about the surface of which planet?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> card_3 = Card.new("Describe in words the exact direction that is 697.5° clockwise from due north?", "North north west", :STEM)
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa161a136f0 @answer="North north west", @question="Describe in words the exact direction that is 697.5° clockwise from due north?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> deck = Deck.new([card_1, card_2, card_3])
#=> #<Deck:0x00007fa160a38ed8...>

pry(main)> round = Round.new(deck)
#=> #<Round:0x00007f972a1c7960...>,

pry(main)> round.deck
#=> #<Deck:0x00007fa160a38ed8...>

pry(main)> round.turns
#=> []

pry(main)> round.current_card
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa16104e160 @answer="Juneau", @question="What is the capital of Alaska?", @category=:Geography>

pry(main)> new_turn = round.take_turn("Juneau")
#=> #<Turn:0x00007f99842f09e8 @card=#<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c9 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>, @guess="Juneau">

pry(main)> new_turn.class
#=> Turn

pry(main)> new_turn.correct?
#=> true

pry(main)> round.turns
#=> [#<Turn:0x00007f99842f09e8 @card=#<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c9 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>, @guess="Juneau">]

pry(main)> round.number_correct
#=> 1

pry(main)> round.current_card
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa160a62e90 @answer="Mars", @question="The Viking spacecraft sent back to Earth photographs and reports about the surface of which planet?", @category=:STEM>

pry(main)> round.take_turn("Venus")
#=> #<Turn:0x00007f972a215b38...>

pry(main)> round.turns.count
#=> 2

pry(main)> round.turns.last.feedback
#=> "Incorrect."

pry(main)> round.number_correct
#=> 1

pry(main)> round.number_correct_by_category(:Geography)
#=> 1

pry(main)> round.number_correct_by_category(:STEM)
#=> 0

pry(main)> round.percent_correct
#=> 50.0

pry(main)> round.percent_correct_by_category(:Geography)
#=> 100.0

pry(main)> round.current_card
#=> #<Card:0x00007fa161a136f0 @answer="North north west", @question="Describe in words the exact direction that is 697.5° clockwise from due north?", @category=:STEM>
```

## Iteration 3

Playing the Game!

So far we’ve focused on modeling the data, classes, and methods that make up our game. However we haven’t done much to put any kind of useable interface onto the game. In this iteration, let’s remedy this by adding a simple Command-Line-Interface (CLI) to the game.

A few key points to keep in mind as you work on this iteration:

We’ll abandon testing for this bit – the techniques for testing this kind of input/output behavior are somewhat involved and are beyond the scope of this project
Use puts to display a line of text output to the user
Use gets to read a line of text input from the user (this will be important to allow users to enter guesses)
In this iteration we’ll introduce a new file called a “runner” – its job is to serve as the main entry point to our program by starting up a new game
First, create your runner file: `touch flashcard_runner.rb`

Inside of this file, write the code to do the following:

Create some Cards
Put those card into a Deck
Create a new Round using the Deck you created
Start the round using a new method called start
Keep in mind that your existing objects should already contain, more or less, the data and methods needed to manage this process. Your challenge in this iteration is to build out the input/output messaging to support the user’s card experience using your existing pieces to store and manage all the necessary data.

When we start the round by running ruby flashcard_runner.rb, it should produce the following interaction from the command line:
```
Welcome! You're playing with 4 cards.
-------------------------------------------------
This is card number 1 out of 4.
Question: What is 5 + 5?
```
Then a user will be able to type in a guess, in this case 10, and hit enter to move the game play forward.

```
10
Correct!
This is card number 2 out of 4.
Question: What is Rachel's favorite animal?
```

The game will continue until all the Cards in the Deck have had a guess made against them (until you have completed as many Turns as you have Cards in the Deck).

```
panda
Incorrect.
This is card number 3 out of 4.
Question: What is Mike's middle name?
nobody knows
Correct!
This is card number 4 out of 4.
Question: What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?
Justin Bieber
Correct!
```

When all the Turns have been made, the game will end and will present the user with a final score.

```
****** Game over! ******
You had 3 correct guesses out of 4 for a total score of 75%.
STEM - 100% correct
Turing Staff - 50% correct
Pop Culture - 100% correct
```

Seen together, the CLI will look something like this when the game is over:

```
Welcome! You're playing with 4 cards.
-------------------------------------------------
This is card number 1 out of 4.
Question: What is 5 + 5?
10
Correct!
This is card number 2 out of 4.
Question: What is Rachel's favorite animal?
panda
Incorrect.
This is card number 3 out of 4.
Question: What is Mike's middle name?
nobody knows
Correct!
This is card number 4 out of 4.
Question: What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?
Justin Bieber
Correct!
****** Game over! ******
You had 3 correct guesses out of 4 for a total score of 75%.
STEM - 100% correct
Turing Staff - 50% correct
Pop Culture - 100% correct
```

## Iteration 4

Loading Text Files

Right now, we’re hardcoding the flashcards into our runner. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a whole text file of questions and answers to use?

Let’s build an object that will read in a text file and generate cards. Go back to using TDD for this iteration.

Assuming we have a text file cards.txt that looks like this:
```
What is 5 + 5?,10,STEM
What is Rachel's favorite animal?,red panda,Turing Staff
What is Mike's middle name?,nobody knows,Turing Staff
What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?,Justin bieber,PopCulture
```

Then we should be able to do this:

```
pry(main)> require './lib/card_generator'
#=> true

pry(main)> filename = "cards.txt"
#=> "cards.txt"

pry(main)> cards = CardGenerator.new(filename).cards
#=> [#<Card:0x007f9f1413cbe8 @answer="10", @question="What is 5 + 5?", @category="STEM">,
 #<Card:0x007f9f1413c788 @answer="red panda", @question="What is Rachel's favorite animal?", @category="Turing Staff">,
 #<Card:0x007f9f1413c2b0 @answer="nobody knows", @question="What is Mike's middle name?", @category="Turing Staff">,
 #<Card:0x007f9f14137da0 @answer="Justin bieber", @question="What cardboard cutout lives at Turing?", @category="Pop Culture">]
 ```

Modify your program so that when you run ruby flashcard_runner.rb, it uses cards from cards.txt instead of hardcoded cards.
